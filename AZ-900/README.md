# AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
## Cloud Concepts (20-25%)
### Benefits & Considerations of using cloud services
- Benefits of cloud computing
    - high availability
    - scalability
    - elasticity
    - agility
    - disaster recovery
- Capital Expenditure (CapEx) vs. Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
- Consumption-based model

### Categories of cloud services
- Shared responsibility model
- Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
- Serverless computing
- Exercise: identify service type based on a specific use case

### Types of cloud computing
